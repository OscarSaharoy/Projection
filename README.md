# Projection

Simple 3D graphics engine using pygame and numpy. Currently showing only a cube, but the program handles keyboard and mouse inputs allowing you to fly  with WASD, Space and Shift, and look around by dragging the screen.

I am hoping to use this in the future to make more interesting things, so this is a promising proof of concept.
